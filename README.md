## How to code

1. Create a new branch for the thing you're implementing, example: "AddingEnemyAI"
2. Create a new scene in unity, with the name of what youre implementing, and then your name, example: "Adding Enemy AI (name)"

4. Add documentation, like comments where needed
5. If you implemented something complex, add a md document to explain the implementation.
6. Open up a pull requests, if you are done with the code and have _no_ intentions of adding anything else to that branch.
